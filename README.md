# Artist & academic's website and blog (back-end REST API)

The back end of this website/blog is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create a robust and scalable API. Node.js provides the runtime environment, allowing the server to handle multiple requests efficiently. Express is used as the web framework, facilitating the creation of API endpoints and handling HTTP requests and responses. MongoDB serves as the database, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing user data, blog posts, and other relevant information. The API is designed to support various operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, user authentication, and communication with the front end. This back end setup ensures reliable data management and seamless interaction between the client and the server.
